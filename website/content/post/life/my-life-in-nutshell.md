I am categorized as farmer or more precisely, peasant under the registration mechanism originating from 60s but I have worked in Information Technology industry after graduation from university. I spent almost 30 years living in a so told world in which everything would be fine if I just do my things as told. My life would be like getting married at late 20s and getting children before 30s if I just follow the normalcy and tradition but I just couldn't do the same thing because of the changing society. 

I was promised to be provided with accommodation by the company that recruited me from university but it didn't fulfill until two or three weeks after I onboarded. I booked a bed in a cheapest hotel that build in an underground Air-raid shelter.

On August 28th, 2018, I embarked on a journey on which I started to have a glimpse of what life should be like.
