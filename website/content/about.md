Entered 30s at the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, I started to think more about life and myself but it is quite annoying that noting has enlightened me yet. I have watched people's life on different part of the planet through Youtube and Twitter, there are inspirations and sorrows to which I can relate. I think it is time to record my own experiences of walking among the world and reminiscing of past that I never had thought on it because I did not capable of reasoning things at that very moment.
