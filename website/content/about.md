I am categorized as farmer or more precisely, peasant under the registration mechanism originating from 60s but I have worked in Information Technology industry after graduation from university. I spent almost 30 years living in a so told world in which everything would be fine if I just do my things as told. My life would be like getting married at late 20s and getting children before 30s if I just follow the normalcy and tradition but I just couldn't do the same thing because of the changing society. 

I was promised to be provided with accommodation by the company that recruited me from university but it didn't fulfill until two or three weeks after I onboarded. I booked a bed in a cheapest hotel that build in an underground Air-raid shelter.

On August 28th, 2018, I embarked on a journey on which I started to have a glimpse of what life should be like. 

Entered 30s at the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, I started to think more about life and myself but it is quite annoying that noting has enlightened me yet. I have watched people's life on different part of the planet through Youtube and Twitter, there are inspirations and sorrows to which I can relate. I think it is time to record my own experiences of walking among the world and reminiscing of past that I never had thought on it because I did not capable of reasoning things at that very moment.
